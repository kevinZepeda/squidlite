## Use the below to avoid proxy-chaining
always_direct allow all
## Always complete the server-side handshake before client-side (recommended)
ssl_bump bump all
## Prior to squid 3.5 it was done like this:
ssl_bump server-first all
## Allow server side certificate errors such as untrusted certificates, otherwise the connection is closed for such errors
# sslproxy_cert_error allow all
# ## Or maybe deny all server side certificate errors according to your company policy
# #sslproxy_cert_error deny all
# ## Accept certificates that fail verification (should only be needed if using 'sslproxy_cert_error allow all') V3.5s
#sslproxy_flags DONT_VERIFY_PEER


# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
#http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access allow all
